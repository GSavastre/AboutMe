## Hey there! My name is Gabriele, welcome to my profile

### I'm currently :

- Studying for my IT Systems Engineering degree 📚
  
- Working on a microservices based architecture reconstruction for my thesis 👷
  
- Trying to expand my coding skills as much as possible 💻
  
- HODLing on 🚪

I also have other interests, I've built with some friends a silly pickup rally car out of a VW Lupo and used it in a 12h endurance race!🏎️🏁.<br/>
I also like drifting and have some boxing matches under my belt, let's say that I've managed to endure some tough situations 💪.
